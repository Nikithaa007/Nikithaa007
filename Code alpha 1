Sure, here's a basic implementation of a flashcard quiz app using Python:
class Flashcard:
    def __init__(self, question, answer):
        self.question = question
        self.answer = answer

class FlashcardDeck:
    def __init__(self):
        self.flashcards = []

    def add_flashcard(self, flashcard):
        self.flashcards.append(flashcard)

    def quiz(self):
        random.shuffle(self.flashcards)
        correct_answers = 0
        total_questions = len(self.flashcards)

        for flashcard in self.flashcards:
            print(flashcard.question)
            user_answer = input("Your answer: ")
            if user_answer.lower() == flashcard.answer.lower():
                print("Correct!")
                correct_answers += 1
            else:
                print("Incorrect. The correct answer is:", flashcard.answer)

        print("\nQuiz complete!")
        print("You got", correct_answers, "out of", total_questions, "questions correct.")

# Example usage:
deck = FlashcardDeck()
deck.add_flashcard(Flashcard("What is the capital of France?", "Paris"))
deck.add_flashcard(Flashcard("What is the largest planet in our solar system?", "Jupiter"))
deck.add_flashcard(Flashcard("Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?", "William Shakespeare"))

print("Welcome to the Flashcard Quiz App!")
print("Let's start the quiz...\n")
deck.quiz()
